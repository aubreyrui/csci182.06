Dearest Arlecchino, I am writing you this letter to introduce myself. My name is Zy0x, but you can call me Nick. I would love to get to know you better. I am good friends with both Lyney and Lynette (Freminet doesn't talk much) and have heard wonderful things about you. If you would ever happen to have even an ounce of free time, it would be my pleasure -- nay, my honour to accompany you during that period. I have been known as a hero, of sorts (or a villain, if that sounds better to you) and have been known for my benevolent acts of kindness,generosity, and grace. If possible, being blessed by your presence over the course of the weekend or whenever you happen to be available, would allow us to connect and better learn about each other. We could go to the Fontainiane beaches (I speak french), and swim with the seals.I have always loved pyro, both the element and the characters, and you are my fire (the one desire (believe when i say i want it that way)). I will give you all of my Diluc's artifacts if you so desire. I would be honoured and am eagerly awaiting your response. See you soon!
